<H1> A simple modern CMake project.</H1>

*I write this project, because I was struggle to include only Header directories.
<br>I hope this helps other people to work with CMake.*

- this project contains a subdirectory with two header files

<H5>The directory tree is:</H5>

``` 
    - project
    - main.cpp
    - Container
        - ContainerOne.hpp
        - ContainerTwo.hpp
        - CMakeLists.txt
    - tests
        - test.cpp
    - cmake-build-debug
        - some files that cmake creates..
    - CMakeLists.txt
    - README.md
